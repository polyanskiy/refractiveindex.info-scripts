refractiveindex.info database, including data validation, format
conversion, and calculation of optical constants based on published
models.

## Scripts

### `scripts/`

Python scripts for calculating optical constants using published
dispersion models and parameterizations.

### `check_db/`

Tools for checking the integrity and consistency of the
`refractiveindex.info` database (schema validation, parsing, and basic
sanity checks).

### `agf2yml/`

Conversion tools for transforming ZEMAX `.agf` glass catalog files into
the `YAML` format used by the refractiveindex.info database.

### `ldbb/`

Scripts for calculating optical constants of several metals using
established physical models.
